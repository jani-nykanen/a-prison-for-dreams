## A Prison for Dreams

*A Prison for Dreams* is maybe not-so-surprisingly a yet another 2D metroidvania thing, in the style of my previous games, except better and bigger and more unfinished\* than ever before!

[Play here](https://jani-nykanen.itch.io/a-prison-for-dreams?secret=OroEZ7JIPtbNggiN50o3q8A4t4)


\*Unfinished meaning that it is still in early access, and the full game will be out in early next year. If you want to try the newest development version, there will most likely be a development branch at some point.

## Building

The following tools are required:
- **TypeScript compiler**
- **Git LFS** (to get access to the asset files)
- **Closure compiler** (optional)

To build the game, clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jani-nykanen/a-prison-for-dreams
```
and run 
```
tsc
```
(or `make js` if you have `make` installed). It will compile the TypeScript source to Javascript, and you can run the game by starting a server in the root (for example run `make server` and open `localhost:8000` in your browser).

If you want to compile a redistributable and compressed zip package, run 
```
make CLOSURE_PATH=<path to closure jar file> dist 
```
(there is a bug that requires you to run `tsc` first, otherwise the thing will faill).

If you want to make a lot of changes to the source, it is recommended to compile the source in watch mode (`tsc -w` or `make watch`).
